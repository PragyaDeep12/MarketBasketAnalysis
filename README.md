# MarketBasketAnalysis
Market Basket Analysis is a modelling technique based upon the theory that if you buy a certain group of items, you are more (or less) likely to buy another group of items.
The set of items a customer buys is referred to as an itemset, and market basket analysis seeks to find relationships between purchases.
